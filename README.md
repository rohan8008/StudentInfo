# StudentInfo
1) Implementing an API that retrieves student details from a file(csv/json / any other format)  and returns the data in a paginated manner. The API should accept parameters such as page number and page size to allow pagination.
2) Implement server-side filtering functionality in the backend. The filtering mechanism should allow the UI to send filter criteria to the backend API, which will then return the filtered results to the UI.
